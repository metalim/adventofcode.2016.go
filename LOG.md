## Base structures

* Library is imported from solutions for 2017.

## Day 1

* Walking on grid with field.Step4.

## Day 2

* Walking on grid filled by field.FillFromString.

## Day 3

* Simple triangle check.

## Day 4

* sort.Stable. Btw, it's internals are worth checking.

## Day 5

* crypto/md5.Sum.
* No need to convert hash to string to check zeroes.
* Optimize: no need to use strconv.Itoa either.
